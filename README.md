# Welcome to William Hall's STAT545 Homework #5 Repository

This assignment was a bit of hodge podge of manipulating factor levels and working with plotly. Here is the assignment instructions:

Here are some of the resources I used:

- http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw05/hw05.html
- http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/01/10-tips-for-making-your-r-graphics-look-their-best.html
- https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf
    

I had some difficulty with the ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png) piece, and I couldn't manage to figure it out. Plotly looks like it has a lot of really cool applications and potential. I can't wait to play around with it more :)
